### 🍓 Known Issues

If the GIF doesn’t improve your mood, it’s not a bug — it’s just unlucky timing. <br> IVE girls sang:
> Even if I stumble, luck is always on my side <br> I’m that I’m that girl I’m that (what) I’m that attitude

 So be THAT girl be THE attitude. And this miniapp will boost your luck 🍀
